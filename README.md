# Electric-Vehicle-Analysis
This project analyzes EV adoption trends, highlighting top manufacturers, model distribution, and CAFV eligibility. Tesla leads the market, with increasing EV registrations and government incentives driving growth.


## Project Description
 - This project focuses on analyzing the population of electric vehicles (EVs) using a dataset and a Power BI dashboard. The dataset includes information about EV make, 
   model, model year, electric range, and Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility. The dashboard visualizes key insights, such as total vehicles, trends over time, 
   and distribution by manufacturer and model.

## Project Objective
   The primary objective of this analysis is to understand the trends and patterns in EV adoption. It aims to provide insights into:
   - The total number of EVs and their distribution.
   - The most popular EV manufacturers and models.
   - The eligibility of EVs for clean alternative fuel incentives.
   - Trends in EV adoption over different model years.
   - Regional distribution of EVs.

     
 ## Key Questions
  - How many electric vehicles are currently registered?
  - Which EV manufacturers and models dominate the market?
  - How has EV adoption changed over time?
  - What proportion of EVs are eligible for clean alternative fuel incentives?
  - How are EVs distributed geographically?
  - What is the average electric range of the vehicles?

## Dashboard
  - <a href="https://github.com/dhok07/Electric-Vehicle-Analysis/blob/main/README.md">Electric Vehicle Dashboard</a>

 ## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
   - Total Vehicles: 150.
   - Average Electric Range: 67.88 miles
   - EV Distribution by Model Year: Shows trends in adoption over time.
   - Top EV Manufacturers: Tesla, Nissan, Chevrolet, Ford, BMW, Kia, Toyota, etc.
   - CAFV Eligibility: Percentage of vehicles eligible, not eligible, or unknown.
   - Top EV Models: Tesla Model Y, Tesla Model 3, Nissan Leaf, Chevrolet Bolt, etc.

  ## Process
  - Data Collection: The dataset containing EV registrations was gathered.
  - Data Cleaning & Preparation: Removing inconsistencies, handling missing values, and structuring the dataset for analysis.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends, distribution, and key metrics.
  - Dashboard Creation in Power BI: Developing visual representations of the key insights.
  - Insights & Interpretation: Analyzing the data to derive actionable findings.

  ## Project Insights
  - Tesla dominates the EV market, with Model Y and Model 3 being the most registered vehicles.
  - EV adoption has increased significantly in recent years, with the highest registrations in the latest model years.
  - Over 46% of EVs qualify for clean alternative fuel incentives, but a significant portion (41%) has unknown eligibility.
  - Battery range varies, with an average electric range of 67.88 miles.
  - Certain manufacturers, like Nissan and Chevrolet, also hold a substantial market share, indicating a competitive market beyond Tesla.

    
  ## Conclusion
   - The analysis reveals a growing trend in EV adoption, with Tesla leading the market. Government incentives play a significant role in EV uptake, as shown by the 
    proportion of CAFV-eligible vehicles. The increasing number of registrations in recent years suggests a shift toward sustainable transportation. Further analysis could 
    focus on regional adoption patterns, charging infrastructure, and consumer preferences.
